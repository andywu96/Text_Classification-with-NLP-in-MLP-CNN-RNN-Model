## Hello

👋 Hi, my name is Andy, come from Taiwan, with 2 years working experience as a data analyst

👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and Data Science opportunities in the United States

🌱 I’m currently a Master Student major in Analytics at University of Southern California

💞️ I’m a highly responsible person who is also cooperative, meticulous, and innovative. Always eager to learn new things with considerable passion and curiosity. Based on my study and experiences in Data Analytics, I look forward to exploring more and applying what I have learned to business. No matter facing any challenges, I will be well prepared, adapt to new changes, and tackle them with an optimistic attitude.

## Semi-Supervised-Unsupervised-Learning-Spectral-Clustering-and-Active-Learning-Using-SVM 

This is one of the HW assignment at USC, there are 2 quesitons.

### First, using Monte-Carlo Simulation with 30 runs on Supervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning/ Self-training, Unsupervised Learning, and Spectral Clustering in Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet

1. Supervised Learning - L1-penalized with SVM Model 
2. Semi-Supervised Learning/ Self-Training - L1-penalized with SVM Model 
3. K-Means Clustering (K=2) 
4. Spectral Clustering with RBF kernel 
5. Using Metrics:  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC

### Second, using Monte-Carlo Simulation with 50 runs on Active Learning and Passive learning models in Banknote authentication Data Set 

6. Passive learning- L1-penalized with SVM Model 
7. Active learning- L1-penalized with SVM Model
