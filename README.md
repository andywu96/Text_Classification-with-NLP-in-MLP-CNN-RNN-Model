## Text Classification with NLP in MLP, CNN, and RNN Model

This is the Final Project at USC.

### First, in Data Exploration and Pre-processing, use Word Embeddings with Keras Tensorflow (Tokenize) in 2000 dataset, which include 1000 positive reviews, and 1000 negative reviews. Then, using different model with the Data Set.

1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
2. One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
